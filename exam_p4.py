What is the most interesting/funny/cool thing(s) about Python that you learned from this class or from somewhere else.

You can use code or a short paragraph to illustrate it.

#The most interesting thing about python I learned from is from the Text Analysis case. Using what I learnt from the case, I can analyze any book, speech I like 
#to find the total words, unique words, most common words. I can't imagine how much effort and time it costs to do by hand.
#We can check the word frequencies in descending, ascending order. I believe there are many more tools to analyze text and I will definitely explore more.

#Another thing I find interesting is conditional statement. It seems easy at first when we only have one condition. When it gets more complicated, you need to
#have a clear logic to write a concise code. This is an essential and useful tool as any case could have a conditional statement.

#To conclude, I like this class though it is hard to code; however, I can understand python language after the class. Even if I can't write a concise one by myself
# I can understand what people write online now. Thank you professor.
